## Programming Language

Python

## Original Requirements

Use the camel package to create a multi-agent system where each agent mimics an individual according to podcast scripts from the Podium API and they can chat with each other or with the user.

## Project Name

multi_agent_podcast_system

## Product Goals

- Develop a realistic multi-agent interaction system
- Ensure seamless integration with the Podium API
- Enhance user engagement through interactive chat features

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to interact with agents that mimic podcast personalities.
- As a user, I want agents to have meaningful conversations with each other.
- As a user, I want to be able to input my own topics for discussion.
- As a user, I want the system to provide responses based on podcast scripts.
- As a user, I want a user-friendly interface to navigate agent interactions.

## Competitive Analysis

- Chatbot A: Basic interaction capabilities, lacks podcast integration
- Agent System B: Advanced AI but no user interaction
- Podcast Chat C: Integrates with podcasts but limited agent interaction
- Interactive Agent D: Good user interface but lacks realistic conversation
- Multi-Agent E: Strong agent interaction but no podcast script usage

## Requirement Analysis

The system should leverage the camel package to create agents that can mimic podcast personalities. It must integrate with the Podium API to fetch scripts and enable agents to chat with users and each other, ensuring a realistic and engaging experience.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Integrate with Podium API to fetch podcast scripts']
- ['P0', 'Develop agents using the camel package']
- ['P1', 'Enable user-agent interaction']
- ['P1', 'Facilitate agent-to-agent conversation']
- ['P2', 'Design a user-friendly interface']

## UI Design draft

The interface will feature a chat window for user-agent interaction, a sidebar for agent selection, and a settings menu for customizing conversation topics. The design will be clean and intuitive, focusing on ease of use.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specific functionalities of the camel package and how it should be utilized in the project.
